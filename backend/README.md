# Setting up the development environment for the project

# üõ† Strapi Project Setup & Transfer Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up this Strapi project locally, including restoring the full PostgreSQL database so you can see all the existing content.

---

## ‚úÖ Setup Checklist

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-strapi-project.git
cd your-strapi-project
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Set Up the PostgreSQL Database

#### ‚ûä Create a database:

```bash
createdb eric-backend
```

> You can change the database name, but make sure it matches your `.env` file.

#### ‚ûã Import the provided dump file:

```bash
psql -U your_pg_user -d eric-backend < strapi_dump.sql
```

Replace `your_pg_user` with your local PostgreSQL username.

---

### 4. Create and Configure `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the content provided to you.

> ‚úÖ You can generate secure keys using:
>
> ```bash
> openssl rand -base64 32
> ```

---

### 5. Admin Access

If no admin account exists, you'll be prompted to create one on first visit to `/admin`.  
Otherwise, use credentials provided separately, or reset using:

```bash
npx strapi admin:create-user
```

### 6. Run the Project

```bash
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```

Visit: [http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin)

---

### 7. Open the Admin Console in Your Browser

Once the project is running, open [http://localhost:1337/admin]http://localhost:1337/admin in your web browser to access the Strapi Admin Console. From there you will be able to modify all of the content.

### 8. Generate API token

In the admin console, under settings -> API tokens, generate a new token. You can then add that token to the .env of the front end that needs to access the strapi backend so that it can be authorized.
